2.  ‘ERROR’ andDisplay a Line From a File Containing the Keyword Its Surrounding Lines?


sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~$ vi file8_day2.txt
sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~$ cat file8_day2.txt


error is a key word
donot do error
it will cause problem
i dont like error


sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~$ grep -v error file8_day2.txt


it will cause problem




3.        Filter out repeated lines in a file.


sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~$ touch file6_day2.txt


sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~$ vi file6_day2.txt


sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~$ sort -u file6_day2.txt


im from kolkata
im sayanik


4.Given a file find the count of lines containing the word “ABC”.


        sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~$ grep -c abc file3_day2.txt




5.Create file.txt that consist of following
sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~$ touch file.txt
sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~$ vi file.txt
sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~$ cat file.txt


Unix is opensource
Unix is powerful
unix is secure
unix is robust
Unix commands are easy to learn
abc wants to learn shell scripting
abc is name of a person
rank of abc is 7
rank of raju is 9


5.a  Find unix string in file.txt using grep


        sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~$ grep -n unix file.txt


3:unix is secure
4:unix is robust


5.b  Find unix string in all files from current directory using grep
        
sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~$ grep -r unix /home/sayanik
/home/sayanik/file.txt:unix is secure
/home/sayanik/file.txt:unix is robust


5.c  Print all the file names where “Unix” or “unix” string is found using grep


        sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~$ grep -ri unix /home/sayanik


/home/sayanik/file.txt:Unix is opensource
/home/sayanik/file.txt:Unix is powerful
/home/sayanik/file.txt:unix is secure
/home/sayanik/file.txt:unix is robust
/home/sayanik/file.txt:Unix commands are easy to learn


5.d  Print all the lines that has pen or per in file.txt using grep


        sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~$ grep -n 'pen\|per' file.txt


1:Unix is opensource
7:abc is name of a person


6.Create 4 files with different text in it and then create a zip file to archive all 4 files ? 


sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~$ touch file1_day2.txt file4_day2.txt file4_day2.txt file4_day2.txt


sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~$ cat file1_day2.txt file2_day2.txt file3_day2.txt file4_day2.txt


this is my first shell scripting session
I love to learn shell scripting
It based on Linux operating system
It can be done in cloudera as well as wsl


sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~$ zip shell_file.zip file1_day2.txt file2_day2.txt file3_day2.txt file4_day2.txt
  adding: file1_day2.txt (stored 0%)
  adding: file2_day2.txt (stored 0%)
  adding: file3_day2.txt (stored 0%)
  adding: file4_day2.txt (deflated 5%)


7.Create a separate directory and unzip the file created in the previous question ? 


        sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~$ cp shell_file.zip dir1_zipped
        
sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~/dir1_zipped$ ls -l


total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 sayanik sayanik 794 Jun 24 13:13 shell_file.zip


sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~/dir1_zipped$ unzip shell_file.zip


Archive:  shell_file.zip
 extracting: file1_day2.txt
 extracting: file2_day2.txt
 extracting: file3_day2.txt
  inflating: file4_day2.txt




8. Create a file1.txt and file2.txt with text as below:


sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~/dir1_zipped$  sort -nu file1.txt  file2.txt  -o file3.txt


sayanik@DESKTOP-E5659VU:~/dir1_zipped$  cat file3.txt
